Welcome to my coding repository for the winter break of 2025-2026. 

I am currently studying physics at university with the goal of becoming a physics professor/researcher. Last semester in college, I realized that, when compared to my physics and math skills, my programming skills are severly lacking and need to be strengthend. 

The goal here is to remedy my coding knolwedge gap by doing a crash course in scientific computing and the essential coding skills needed for physics. Jupyter notebooks will be used to take notes, and hopefully I'll have some projects synthesizing what I've learned.

This Readme will house the curriculum for what I want to cover going forward and let me keep track of what I've covered:

What to address next session (remove as items are completed):
- Branching in Git
- How to use GitHub in VSCode
- Figure out how to integrate GitHub Copilot

What to address in the near future:
- Debugger in VSCode
- Virtual Environments, WSL, and how the remote explorer option works in VSCode

IMPORTANT: When getting tired of a topic, switch over to another topic instead of taking a break or doomscrolling. There should be enough to cover (and plenty of cool topics) that foreward momentum is critical.

Long Term Outilne for the break:

The Core Curriculum:
- Get Comfortable with VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub
- Scientific Python Modules: Matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas and sympy
- Computational Linear ALgebra (Cover when Tired of Straight coding)
- MIT's The Missing Semester of Your CS Education
- MIT opencourseware Introduction To Algorithms
- Signal Processing Topics (FFTs)
- CRPropa tutorials + advance research code

Additional Topics (if time):
- SQL crash course
- Manim
- Machiene Learning
- MATLAB
- Monte Carlo Methods
